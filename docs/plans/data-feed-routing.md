## 0. WHAT R-38 IS

A **provider routing matrix**: a **per asset-class × listing-country** mapping that
says *which provider prices this kind of instrument in this market*. Today routing
is resolved by a fixed lane policy (`DEFAULT_PRIORITY`) + the active provider + a
per-instrument `source_override`. R-38 adds a **user-editable mapping table** as one
new precedence layer, with a canonical editor in **Settings → Data feeds** (§14st-1)
and per-cell provenance surfaced (read-only) on **Pricing Health**.

The platform still **never fabricates a price** and **never advises**; this is a
routing-*configuration* surface, not a pricing change. It **inherits verbatim** the
router's standing guarantee: *the active market provider can never overwrite a NAV
or a canonical-id crypto price with a wrong equity quote*
(`05-PROVIDERS-AND-ROUTING.md:106-107`; `router.py:245-276` + `services/market.py`
`refresh_quote`).

**R-38 is NOT R-13.** D-072 parks *per-lane provider **priority** editing* as R-13
(*"no user-editable provider priority in v2 — visibility yes, editability no"*,
`ROADMAP.md:26`; `page-pricing-health.md:146`). R-38 is a **different shape** — a
cell *selects one provider* for a class×country; it does **not** reorder a lane's
priority chain. The editor lives in **Settings**, not Pricing Health (which stays
read-only, D-072). See §9 item R for the explicit reconciliation the owner must
ratify.

## 1. THE KEPT MACHINERY (verify-first, confirmed 2026-07-18)

Recorded so the milestone does not rebuild what exists. Each claim is grepped.

| Kept | Where (verified) |
|------|------------------|
| `CAPABILITIES` registry declares `asset_classes` + `regions` **per provider** | `router.py:53` (dict), dataclass `ProviderCapabilities` `:31-46` (`asset_classes: frozenset` `:44`, `regions: frozenset` — ISO-3166 alpha-2 or `"*"` `:45`) |
| The pure resolver `route()` takes `asset_class` / `asset_subclass` / `listing_country` and resolves against the policy | `router.py:195-287`; `lane_for(...)` `:128-149`; `DEFAULT_PRIORITY` `:112-125` |
| A **per-instrument `source_override`** precedence slot already exists and wins first | `router.py:236-241` (`if source_override in CAPABILITIES:`) |
| Edit-time override validation (the rejection precedent R-38 inherits) | `services/market.py` `validate_source_override` (returns `(None, error)` → the route turns it into a 400) |
| Live context gathering (what R-38's matrix lookup will extend) | `services/market.py` `route_for_instrument` — gathers `mappings`, `active_provider`, `has_manual`, `source_override`, `availability`, then calls `route()` |
| `capabilities_for(name)` lookup helper; `provider_availability()` | `router.py:93-95`; `services/market.py` |
| Alpha Vantage learned tier (`av_tier`), ETF-proxy fallback when not premium | `external.py:96-110` (`av_tier` `:108`, `_index_entitled` `:99`), `:104-105` (`supports_indices`), `:140`/`:152-153` (learns premium/free), `:44-45` (proxy comment) |

> The capability model a validated matrix needs — *"which providers cover which
> class×region"* — **already exists**. R-38 is the mapping layer + its editing + its
> provenance, **not** the capability engine.

---

## VERIFY-FIRST DELIVERABLE — THE CAPABILITY-COVERAGE TABLE

From the **actual registry** (`router.py:53-90`). This is the reality §9 is ruled
against — not memory. `fetch_on_demand=False` ⇒ rate-limited (serve cache, refresh
via worker/button, `:42`).

| Provider | asset_classes | regions | needs_key | entitlement | fetch_on_demand | Tier variance |
|----------|---------------|---------|:---------:|-------------|:---------------:|---------------|
| `mock` | all (`_ALL`) | `*` | – | delayed | ✓ | — |
| `csv` | equity, etf | `*` | – | end-of-day | ✓ | — |
| `yahoo` | all | `*` | – | delayed | ✗ | — |
| `alphavantage` | equity, etf, fx, crypto, **index** | US, `*` | ✓ | delayed | ✗ | **`av_tier` premium/free/unknown — `index` is premium-only; free keys fall back to ETF proxies** (`external.py:96-110`) |
| `amfi_nav` | mutual_fund | IN | – | end-of-day | ✗ | — (cache-publish; `amfi_code`) |
| `coingecko` | crypto | `*` | – | delayed | ✗ | — (cache-publish; `coingecko_id`) |
| `ecb_fx` | fx | `*` | – | end-of-day | ✗ | — (quote=False; FX fallback only) |
| `eodhd` | equity, etf, fx, crypto, index, mutual_fund | US, SG, IN, `*` | ✓ | delayed | ✗ | — |
| `kite` | equity, derivative, commodity | IN | ✓ | delayed | ✗ | — |

**`_ALL` = `{equity, etf, index, fx, crypto, commodity}`** (`router.py:52`).

### The CURRENT resolution chain, as implemented in `route()` — step by step

Read from `router.py:216-287` (do not assume — this is the code order):

0. **Compute lane + chain** (`:216-217`): `lane = lane_for(class, subclass, country)`
   (`:128-149`); `chain = DEFAULT_PRIORITY[lane]` (`:112-125`, falls back to
   `["manual"]`).
1. **`source_override`** (`:236-242`): if `source_override in CAPABILITIES` → **it
   wins**, `market_quote` (or `official_nav` for amfi_nav), returns. Unknown override
   → ignored, reason recorded, falls through.
2. **Manual-only lanes** (`:245-249`): `lane in _MANUAL_LANES` (`= {manual_only,
   deposit}`, `:156`) → `manual` if `has_manual` else `None`+"set a manual value".
   Returns. *A feed never prices these.*
3. **Cache-publish lanes** (`:255-276`): for `amfi_nav↔amfi_code` /
   `coingecko↔coingecko_id` (`_CACHE_PUBLISH`, `:154`) on `mutual_fund`/`crypto`:
   - mapped **and** `cached_source == src` → the cache-publish source **owns** it
     (`official_nav` / `market_quote`), returns (`:258-261`).
   - `mutual_fund` is **strict**: mapped-but-no-NAV → "awaiting NAV"; unmapped →
     `mapping_required`, manual/None. **Returns** (`:262-273`) — *never an equity
     feed for a fund.*
   - `crypto` unmapped → sets `mapping_required` then **breaks/falls through** to the
     active provider (`:274-276`). *Symbol pricing legitimately continues.*
4. **Active provider** (`:279-282`): if `active_provider in chain` **or** `== "mock"`
   → `market_quote`, returns.
5. **Else** (`:284-287`): `manual` if `has_manual` else `None`+"no configured source
   can price this holding".

`_finish` (`:224-232`) then computes the `_auth_gap` (`:161-175`) and sets
`auth_required` when a **higher-priority, configured, keyed** source is missing
credentials.

**The NAV/canonical-crypto guarantee lives in steps 2–3 returning before step 4.**
Any R-38 matrix cell MUST slot so that steps 1–3 still fire first — see §9 item 1.

---

## 2. IDENTITY

*R-38 is not a new page.* It is **three coordinated changes** to existing surfaces
(the page-chrome / first-run retrospectives: a plan may govern a cross-cutting
capability, not a single route). Identity per affected surface:

| Surface | What R-38 adds | Template / spec ref |
|---------|----------------|---------------------|
| **`route()` resolver** (backend) | one new precedence layer (the matrix cell) between override and active provider | `router.py`; `05-PROVIDERS-AND-ROUTING.md` §A.6 |
| **Settings → Data feeds** (`/settings?tab=data-feeds`) | the **matrix editor** (canonical home, §14st-1; `page-settings.md:696-704`) | Settings template; DESIGN-SYSTEM §3 |
| **Pricing Health** (`/pricing-health`) | per-instrument **provenance**: which provider priced this, via which rule (read-only, D-072) | Worklist template; `page-pricing-health.md` |

**One-line purpose:** let the owner declare *which provider prices each asset-class ×
listing-country*, validated against real capability, as a refinement layer that can
never silently repoint an instrument or overwrite a NAV.

---

## 3. OWNERSHIP TABLE

**Owns (canonical, authoritative):**
- **The routing matrix** (the class×country→provider mapping) — canonical editor home
  is **Settings → Data feeds** (P-1; `page-settings.md:702`). One home; Pricing Health
  *reads* provenance, never owns the matrix.
- **The routing *decision*** stays owned by `route()` (backend) — **served, never
  re-derived frontend** (D-105/P-1; `page-pricing-health.md:52`).

**Summarises (via the named reader, linked, never recomputed):**

| Summary shown | Canonical page | Shared reader reused | Link target |
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Per-instrument "priced by X via rule Y" | Pricing Health (provenance/routing diagnostics, D-038) | `route()` via `route_for_instrument` (the SAME reader the page already serves) | Pricing Health row-detail |
| "Provider" / "Data provider" wording | Settings (D-028 split — Provider is a Settings-only concept) | `/system/data-source` served list | Settings → Data feeds |

**Enforcement corollary (P-1/D-031):** Pricing Health may only *display* the matrix
outcome that `route()` returns — it adds **no** new figure and **no** editing (D-072,
`page-pricing-health.md:146`, `:176`). The matrix editor adds **no** routing math to
the frontend — every validation/decision is served (D-105).

**Links to:** Pricing Health ⇄ Settings → Data feeds (the "correct-source" ⇄
"routing policy" pair).

## 4. API SURFACE

### 4a. Endpoints consumed (already in the frozen contract — 132 paths baseline)

| Method + path | Purpose on this milestone | Response shape pinned? |
|---------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| `GET /api/v1/refdata` | class/country/provider vocabularies (D-005 zero-copy) for the editor `MasterSelect`s; already serves `source_override` provider list from CAPABILITIES (`API-CONTRACT.md:69`) | ✓ `{value,label}` |
| `GET/PUT /api/v1/system/data-source` | active provider + write-only key (the *appliance default*, D-014/D-003; `system.py:113,158`; `page-settings.md:152`) — **the migration baseline for §9 item 4** | ✓ |
| `GET /api/v1/portfolio/pricing-health` | per-holding routing diagnostics (already serves `route_source`/`route_lane`/`priority_chain`; `page-pricing-health.md:67,130-131`) — R-38 **reshapes** it (§4b) | ✓ |
| `PATCH /api/v1/instruments/{symbol}` (`source_override`) | the existing per-instrument correction (validated; `page-pricing-health.md:70`) — unchanged, still wins over the matrix | ✓ |

### 4b. Contract deltas (needed but not in the baseline — BUILD BACKEND-FIRST)

Each row built backend-first; regenerate `API-CONTRACT.json` + `docs/openapi.json`
**same commit** (`make api-contract-check`). Served **display strings** throughout
(D-105/D-005). `response_model` must declare every served field or it is stripped
(the `price_display` lesson, TEMPLATE §3b).

| kind | Endpoint (current → intended) | Decision | Why this milestone needs it |
|------|-------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------|
| add | `GET /api/v1/system/routing-matrix` | R-38 | list all matrix cells (served class/country/provider labels + degraded flags) for the editor |
| add | `PUT /api/v1/system/routing-matrix` | R-38 | upsert one cell (class×country→provider); **edit-time validated** → honest **400** on a capability mismatch (the `validate_source_override` precedent), per §9 item 3 |
| add | `DELETE /api/v1/system/routing-matrix/{class}/{country}` | R-38 | clear a cell → falls back to lane/active (§9 item 2). Rename/removal tests discriminate by **shape**, not status (SPA serves 200 HTML) — TEMPLATE §3b |
| reshape | `GET /api/v1/portfolio/pricing-health` (+ `route_rule`) | R-38 / §9 item 10 | RouteDiagnostic gains a served `route_rule` (`override`/`matrix`/`lane`/`active`) — **one derivation** from `route()`, surfaced read-only |

**Guards audited (TEMPLATE §3b, page-news §13a):** the matrix CRUD is a **mutation**
→ `require_auth` (the `source_override` PATCH precedent, `page-pricing-health.md:70`).
No egress is added (routing config is local). Resolve-time re-validation is a
**behaviour** (invisible to a shape check) → pinned by a fail-first test (§9 item 3).

---

## 5. NEW DATA MODEL (the missing scope — mapping table)

*Home: `02-DATA-MODEL.md`; migration posture: ADR-0001 (keep the legacy Alembic
chain; new tables are additive migrations on head). Current single head =
`b3e2f1a9c740` (`institution_fk`).*

A new persisted model, mirroring the existing cache/master table pattern
(`amfi_schemes` `02-DATA-MODEL.md:152`, `coingecko_coins` `:163`):

- **`routing_matrix`** — columns (PROPOSED, ratify at build): `id` PK · `asset_class`
  (String, `AssetClass` vocab) · `listing_country` (String — ISO-3166 alpha-2 **or**
  `"*"`, mirroring `CAPABILITIES.regions`) · `provider` (String, a CAPABILITIES name)
  · `updated_at`. **Unique** on `(asset_class, listing_country)` — one provider per
  cell.
- **Migration:** additive `create_table` on head `b3e2f1a9c740`, with a full
  `downgrade()` (the `f9e1a2b3c4d5` drop-migration precedent, data-guarded), per
  ADR-0001.
- **Default content:** **empty** (§9 item 4/2) — an empty matrix changes *nothing*
  (falls through to today's lane/active behaviour). This honours the PARAM-WINS
  honesty precedent (Amendment A): *the defaults must not silently repoint any
  instrument's current provider.*

---

## 6. COMPONENTS

*Ratified `src/components/ui/` only. Any affordance the inventory lacks → a §5
DESIGN-SYSTEM amendment raised at Phase 0a (the Pricing-Health route-chain / Holdings
lessons). No new component without an amendment.*

| Ratified component | Role | Data source | Prop/state not exercised at kitchen-sink |
|--------------------|------|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| `DataTable` | the matrix grid (rows = class×country cells; columns = provider + degraded state) | `GET /system/routing-matrix` (real) | editable-cell rows (see amendment flag) |
| `MasterSelect` | per-cell provider picker — **capability-filtered served options** (D-005) | `/refdata` provider list (real) | option subset filtered by class×country |
| `StatusChip` / `StalenessChip` | honest degraded-cell state (needs-key / tier-degraded / incapable) | served display strings | degraded-cell tone |
| `ConfirmDialog (+PIN?)` | gate for a matrix write (`require_auth`) | — | auth-gated config write |
| `MetaStrip` | (Pricing Health) the read-only per-instrument route rule/lane/source | served `route_rule`/`route_lane`/`route_source` | already used for the route chain (`page-pricing-health.md:98`) |

**Affordances the inventory may lack (amendment gate — see §9 item 9):**
- An **editable-cell grid** (a `DataTable` whose cells host a `MasterSelect`) is not
  in the ratified inventory as a pattern. If the build can compose it from
  `DataTable` + `MasterSelect` (a cell renderer), **no amendment**; if it needs a new
  affordance, it is a **§5 amendment raised at Phase 0a**, exactly like Pricing
  Health's route-chain affordance (`page-pricing-health.md:104-106`).

**Usage rules honoured:** served vocab zero-copy (D-005); popovers portal to viewport
(the `MasterSelect` dropdown); no decision IDs in user copy (copy hygiene, §11-8);
label changes are app-wide (§11-4).

**Tables (D-094):** the matrix is **bounded** (≤ `AssetClass` (13) × declared regions
— tens of cells) → **client-side** sort/filter is acceptable; record the assumption.
Pricing Health's diagnostics table keeps its existing server-side posture.

---

## 7. VOCABULARIES

*Source: MASTER-DATA.md + the router registry. Every categorical is a served
display string (D-005) — never hardcode a provider/class/country label.*

| Field | Vocabulary / master | Fixed (/refdata) or extensible | Ref |
|-------|---------------------|-------------------------------|-----|
| Matrix row **asset_class** | `AssetClass` (13: equity, etf, mutual_fund, bond, cash, fixed_deposit, commodity, crypto, property, private, retirement, liability, other) | Fixed (`/refdata`, D-005) | `MASTER-DATA.md:56` (D-010) |
| Matrix row **listing_country** | ISO-3166 **alpha-2 + `"*"` wildcard** — mirroring `CAPABILITIES.regions` | Fixed (the router's own region vocab; **NOT** the D-083 six-bucket model — §9 item 5) | `router.py:45`; `MASTER-DATA.md` §4 / D-083 |
| Matrix cell **provider** | CAPABILITIES provider names (served, the `source_override` list already does this) | Fixed (`/refdata`, D-005) | `router.py:53`; `API-CONTRACT.md:69` |
| Provenance **route rule** | `override` / `matrix` / `lane` / `active` (served labels) | Fixed (served) | §9 item 10 |

**Terminology (GLOSSARY parity — spec-first, page-heatmap §13-1):** the D-028 split
already defines **Provider** (Settings-only), **Source** (user-facing provenance),
**Routing/route** (internal + Pricing Health only) — `GLOSSARY.md:98-106,312-313`.
Any **new** user-facing term R-38 introduces (e.g. *"Routing matrix"* if shown as a
label) is authored **in `GLOSSARY.md` first**, then the popover data, guarded by
`test_glossary_parity.py` — see §9 item T. *"Data feeds"* is a plain tab label with
no entry (the §14st-1/§9-4 logic, `page-settings.md:709`).

---

## 8. DECISIONS IN FORCE

| Decision | What it forbids / requires here |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| **NAV/canonical guarantee** (`05` §A.6, `router.py:245-276`) | the matrix MUST slot **after** steps 2–3 (manual-only, cache-publish) so it can **never** overwrite a NAV or a mapped-and-published canonical crypto price — inherited verbatim (§9 item 1). |
| **D-072** (`page-pricing-health.md:146`) | routing chain is **visible, never editable** on Pricing Health; the matrix editor lives in **Settings**; **no provider-priority (lane-order) editing** — R-13 stays parked (§9 item R). |
| **PARAM-WINS honesty / Amendment A** | the default (empty) matrix must **not silently repoint** any instrument's current provider (§9 item 2/4). |
| **D-005 / D-105 / P-1** | matrix vocabularies + the routing decision are **served**, zero frontend copy, zero frontend routing math; one canonical home. |
| **D-014 / D-003** (`page-settings.md:49`) | the active provider + write-only key are the **appliance default** (env-backed via `/system/data-source`); §9 item 4 rules the matrix's relation to it. |
| **API-CONTRACT freeze** | matrix endpoints ship backend-first, contract regenerated same commit; `route_rule` added to the typed model AND regenerated. |
| **ADR-0001** | the new table is an **additive migration on the kept legacy chain**, with a full downgrade. |
| **D-028** (`GLOSSARY.md:98`) | Provider stays a Settings-only word; Pricing Health shows **Source/Routing**, not "Provider". |

---

## 9. NEEDS DECISION — §9 items (PROPOSED resolutions; ⚑ = genuine owner call)

*Do not build on any open item. Resolutions below are PROPOSED; the §9 one-pass with
the owner ratifies each. Ruled strictly against the coverage table + the verified
`route()` chain above, never memory.*

| # | Item | Why it blocks / what's needed | PROPOSED resolution (owner to approve) |
|---|------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **1 ⚑** | **The precedence slot** | Exactly where the matrix cell sits in the verified `route()` chain. | **Insert a new step "3.5" immediately before the active-provider fallback (`router.py:279`), after override (step 1), manual-only (step 2), and cache-publish/NAV (step 3) have returned.** The matrix cell then *replaces* `active_provider` as the market-provider consulted at step 4, for market lanes only. This inherits the NAV/canonical guarantee **verbatim** (steps 2–3 already returned) and matches the stub's "between override and active provider." Encoded fail-first in `route()` with pinned tests. |
| **2 ⚑** | **Unmapped-cell semantics** | A class×country with no matrix cell: refine, or declare "unrouted"? | **Fall through to the current lane chain / active provider (matrix as a *refinement*, not a gate).** An empty/absent cell = today's behaviour exactly → honours PARAM-WINS (no silent repoint). Pricing Health shows `route_rule = lane`/`active` for these. *Reject* explicit "unrouted" as the default — it would repoint instruments to `None` and break the guarantee. (Owner may opt into an explicit-unrouted mode per-cell later; not the default.) |
| **3** | **Capability validation, edit- AND resolve-time** | A cell may name only a provider whose CAPABILITIES cover that class×country. | **Edit-time:** `PUT` re-uses the `validate_source_override` logic (`services/market.py`) — `caps.asset_classes ∋ class` (or `*`) **AND** `caps.regions ∋ country` (or `*`), else an **honest 400** with the reason ("`{prov}` can't price a `{class}`" / "doesn't cover `{country}`"). **Resolve-time:** `route()` **re-validates** the cell against live CAPABILITIES (defence in depth, the `source_override` unknown-source precedent `:237`) — an incapable/stale cell is **ignored**, falls through to lane/active. Both pinned fail-first. |
| **4 ⚑** | **Migration of the single-provider config** | Does the active provider become the matrix default row, or stay a separate fallback layer? | **Stay a separate fallback layer (option B).** The active provider is an **appliance/env** setting (D-014), not per-cell data; keeping it as the terminal fallback means an **empty matrix changes nothing** (PARAM-WINS). `/system/data-source` **and** the Settings Data-feeds provider control are **unchanged** — the matrix is purely additive above them. *(Alternative A — active provider = the `*×*` default cell — would migrate an env setting into the DB and is rejected unless the owner wants a single control.)* |
| **5** | **Matrix dimensions** | Which country vocabulary is canonical for rows? | **asset_class × listing_country, country = ISO-3166 alpha-2 + `"*"` wildcard**, mirroring `CAPABILITIES.regions` (`router.py:45`) — the vocabulary `route()` actually resolves against. **NOT** the D-083 six-bucket region model (that is a *display* taxonomy; the resolver uses alpha-2). Resolves the stub's "country vocabulary" NEEDS-DECISION. Subclass granularity is **out** (class×country only) unless the owner widens it. |
| **6 ⚑** | **Lane scope** | Which lanes does the matrix govern? | **Quotes lane only.** `fx` routing (`services/fx.py`, a different consumer) and `news` feeds (`news.py` `/news/feeds`) are **explicit non-scope** — recorded here, not built — unless the owner widens R-38. |
| **7 ⚑** | **Keyed provider in a cell, no key set** | A cell names a `needs_key` provider with no credentials. | **Accept-with-caveat → honest degraded cell, never a silent dead cell.** Unlike `source_override` (an immediate correction that 400s on missing creds), the matrix is *forward-looking policy* — keys and policy are set independently. Edit-time **accepts** a *capable-but-unkeyed* provider but the cell shows a **degraded chip** ("needs credentials — add them in Settings"); resolve-time's `_auth_gap` (`:161-175`) already flags `auth_required` and the cell falls through until the key lands. *(Capability mismatch — item 3 — is still a hard 400; only the credentials case is accept-with-caveat.)* |
| **8 ⚑** | **Tier-dependent capabilities** (owner-raised 2026-07-18) | A provider's effective coverage varies by key tier (`av_tier`: `index` premium-only; ETF proxies when free). How does validation treat tier-unknown, resolve-time use the learned tier, and Pricing Health label a tier-degraded cell? | **Grounded strictly in `external.py:96-157`.** (a) **Scope note:** `av_tier` varies **`index` only** (`_AV_INDEX_SYMBOLS`); `index` is **not a holdings quote-lane** (`DEFAULT_PRIORITY` has no index lane), so within R-38's quotes-lane scope the tier variance is **narrow** — it bites the Markets/Global surface, not holding routing. (b) **Edit-time:** validate against **declared** CAPABILITIES (`alphavantage` declares `index`, `:67`); `av_tier` is **learned at runtime, not persisted** (`:99`), so edit-time **accepts with caveat** (block would be dishonest — the tier is genuinely unknown until the first probe). (c) **Resolve-time:** honours the **learned** `av_tier` via the **existing** ETF-proxy fallback (`:104-105`, `:149-157`) — **no new tier semantics invented**. (d) **Pricing Health:** a tier-degraded cell shows a **served honest string** (e.g. *"index via ETF proxy — key not premium"*), never a fabricated real-index label. |
| **9** | **The editor UI** | Ratified components only; an editable-cell grid may be a new pattern. | **Compose `DataTable` + `MasterSelect` (cell renderer) + `StatusChip`** — all ratified. If the editable-cell-grid composes cleanly, **no amendment**; if it needs a new affordance, it is a **§5 amendment raised at Phase 0a** (the route-chain precedent). Anything beyond the inventory is surfaced there, never improvised mid-build. |
| **10** | **Provenance on Pricing Health** | Served per-instrument "which provider priced this, via which rule". | **`route()` gains a served `route_rule` field** (`override`/`matrix`/`lane`/`active`) — **one derivation** from the resolver, surfaced in the existing Pricing Health diagnostics (`route_source`/`route_lane`/`priority_chain` already served, `page-pricing-health.md:130-131`). **Read-only** (D-072); the editor stays in Settings. Reshape of `/portfolio/pricing-health` (§4b). |
| **11** | **Contract deltas** | The CRUD + reshape surface. | **`GET`/`PUT` `/system/routing-matrix`, `DELETE /system/routing-matrix/{class}/{country}`, and `route_rule` on `/portfolio/pricing-health`** — backend-first, contract regen same commit, `require_auth` on writes, served display strings (D-105). Baseline 132 → +3 add. Removal/rename tests discriminate by **shape** (§4b). |
| **R ⚑** | **R-38 vs D-072 / R-13 reconciliation** | D-072 forbids "user-editable provider priority" and parks it as R-13; R-38 is user-editable routing. | **R-38 is a *different shape* and does NOT unpark R-13.** The matrix *selects one provider per cell*; it does **not reorder a lane's priority chain**. Pricing Health stays **read-only** (D-072 intact); the editor is a **new Settings surface**. The owner's R-38 activation (`ROADMAP.md:50`) is the ruling that this cell-selection editing is sanctioned where lane-priority editing (R-13) remains parked — **stated here for the owner to affirm**, so the two decisions don't silently conflict. |
| **T** | **Terminology gap** | Any new user-facing R-38 term. | If a label like *"Routing matrix"* is shown, author it in **`GLOSSARY.md` first** (canonical), then `mocks/glossary.ts`, guarded by `test_glossary_parity.py` (page-heatmap §13-1). *"Data feeds"* stays a plain tab label (no entry, §9-4). Confirm at the one-pass which R-38 strings are glossary terms vs plain labels. |

## ROADMAP RIDER (recorded, not built)

**R-40 — Alpha Vantage premium feed expansion** (owner-raised 2026-07-18). Premium-tier
feeds beyond the current lanes (e.g. fundamentals / additional series) MAY serve future
platform needs. **DEFINITION OWED by the owner** — *which* feeds, serving *which* page,
before any plan. Input material: the owner-held vendor documentation (**not** a plan
source — the plan cites adapter code, never vendor PDFs). **Not R-38 scope:** R-38 routes
existing lanes only. → to be added as a dated `ROADMAP.md` entry at the §9 one-pass.

## BUILD PHASES (after §9 one-pass — NOT started)

- **Phase 0 — Contract + model deltas (§4b/§5):** the `routing_matrix` migration
  (ADR-0001, on head `b3e2f1a9c740`) + CRUD endpoints + `route_rule`, backend-first,
  contract regen same commit, `make api-contract-check` green. The precedence slot
  (§9 item 1) + edit/resolve validation (item 3) land here, **fail-first**.
- **Phase 0a — component confirm / amendment (§6/§9 item 9):** confirm the
  editable-cell grid composes from ratified components, or raise the §5 amendment.
- **Phase 1 — assembly:** the Settings → Data feeds editor + Pricing Health
  provenance column; honest degraded/needs-key/tier states.
- **Phase 2 — tests:** validation (edit + resolve), the NAV/canonical guarantee
  regression, provenance reconciliation, overflow suite extended.
- **Phase 3a — scripted pre-pass** (green before the walk) → **Phase 3b — owner
  walk** (judgment only) → **close ritual** (record + push).

**Sign-off to start build:** §9 has no open blocker · §4b deltas approved · no §6
component needs an unresolved amendment.

**Plan-only.** The §9 one-pass happens in chat with the owner. Nothing here commits a
data shape or UI until the owner rules each ⚑.
